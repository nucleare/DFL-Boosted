In accordance with the request of the original creator, we shall make no effort to ruin the  code, respect the logic and pithiness by offerring our found solution 
when or if it is discovered, and create no method of code abstraction that prevents others from understanding or creates more complication to the code's work itself.

Please don't ruin the code and this good (as I think) architecture.
Please follow the same logic and brevity/pithiness.
Don't abstract the code into huge classes if you only win some lines of code in one place, because this can prevent programmers from understanding it quickly.
